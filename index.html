            <h2>Pet Finder Mern Stack Web Application</h2>
            <p>To help pet owners find their lost pets, we have developed PetFinder, a mobile-friendly web app that allows users to create posts about their lost pets. These posts 
                include information about the animal, such as a description, a collection of pictures, and the location where the pet was last seen. Pet Owners can also create pet 
                profiles of their pets, which include a collection of photos and information about the pet.
                Other users can comment on these lost pet posts with additional information, such as reports of sightings or other helpful information. The app also allows users to 
                search for lost pets based on pet attributes, such as breed, color, and size, making it easier to connect a lost pet with the correct post. Additionally, users who 
                have found a pet can contact the pet's owner in the comment section to set up a reunion. If a pet is found, the pet's owner can mark it as found, and the post will 
                be archived. Other users can now see that the pet has been found.
                Users can also keep their profile updated by changing their name, profile picture, and other fields. If a user does not want to make an account, they can still use 
                the application, but their functionality is limited. They can still browse the pet feed and a single post page, but they cannot add their pet, create a post, or interact
                 with comments without an account. Fortunately, creating an account is easy, and only requires a unique username and email, along with a valid password.

            <h2>CLUB SEARCH WEBSITE WITH SQL DATABASE</h2>
            <p>Our project, ClubSearch is intended to improve the reachability and communication between clubs and their members, through one central website. 
                Centralizing all related club information within a website allows students in multiple clubs to quickly access upcoming events for a club, 
                as well as look for new announcement posts. Additionally, students looking to join a new club throughout the school year can quickly find clubs through 
                our website and join it with a simple click of a button. ClubSearch makes use of one central database that connects students with clubs, and allows club representatives 
                to organize upcoming events where they can notify every club member through an announcement. In the case that a student wants to become the founder of a new club, 
                ClubSearch makes it simple by providing a page for new clubs to be created. 
                This website was created with python django framework and an sqllite database. The frontend was created with HTML and CSS bootstrap

            <h2>Analyzing the History of the NFL</h2>
            <p>This is a data story using a dataset containing NFL game data since the beginning of the NFL. This is a deep dive into the history of the NFL to find suprising trends
                and answer some age old questions. Pandas, the python library was used for most the data processing and cleaning, then the majority of the visualizations where
                created through Tableau. The data story contains a mix and stand still visualizations and an interactive on for each reasearch question. The original dataset can be found
                on kaggle but it went through a lot of processing. This project gave me the opportunity to learn alot about deealing with data and being able to visualize it in a appealing way.

            <h2>FITNESS APPLICATION PROTOTYPE IN C#</h2>
            <p>This fitness tracker will provide users with an opportunity to enter physical activity, start training programs, and track their training. 
                The system should also be able to give users the ability to view their progress in their training programs as well as being able to select specific programs to help meet their goals. 
                For an active person or an athlete, these are all fairly typical things they would expect to be able to do from a fitness tracking system. Lastly, any great fitness app should allow for 
                users to set goals, and see their progress towards them. This interface was created in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) using C# and .xaml.

            <h2>CRYPTOCURRRECNY BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
            <p>This is a toy example of a blockchain to simulate a blockchain used for a cryptocurrency. A blockchain is an immutable, 
                sequential chain of records called Blocks which are chained together using hashes. Hashes are the output of a hashing algorithm, 
                where the input is the data stored inside the block. Each Block consists of an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions,
                 a proof-of-work/nonce (more on that later), and the hash of the previous Block. With the help of Object-oriented programming, we can implement a ‘Block’ class containing the relevant 
                 data which can then be created by users and added to the ‘chain’ class. The chain and all of the data in its blocks will be stored in .json files. The hash of each block are computed using 
                 SHA256 functions from Python’s ‘hashlib’ library with all of the data fields of the block as inputs. We used a common constraint of ‘n number of leading zeroes’ on the hash initially, 
                 where n is the nonce value. The value of n or the length of the word is the difficulty, where a higher value takes more time so it is more difficult. Before adding a block to the chain, 
                 the proof of work will be completed, and once verified, it will be added. A list (or other data structure) will contain all of the unverified transactions/blocks. 
                A mining function will continuously run the proof of work function until a valid hash is generated.
